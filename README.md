# Precision Scheduling Tool

This project generates customized lesson schedules from the lesson catalog in `lessons.json`. The user interface lives in `index.html`, and all presentation styles and application logic have been modularized for clarity and reuse.

## File structure

- `index.html` – Markup for the scheduling form and results table. Loads the stylesheet and initializes the JavaScript application.
- `styles.css` – Global styles for layout, typography, form controls, and table presentation.
- `lessons.json` – Source data that contains the full set of lessons.
- `js/app.js` – Application entry point. Wires up the Generate button, orchestrates data fetching, and coordinates the scheduling pipeline.
- `js/ui.js` – Manages form dynamics (pacing toggle, age calculations), exposes helpers to read the user's selections, and updates UI status messages.
- `js/dates.js` – Date utilities used throughout the app (`parseDate`, `fmtDate`, `addDays`, `monthsBetween`).
- `js/pacing.js` – Builds the visit cadence according to the selected pacing rules.
- `js/filters.js` – Filters lessons by participant traits and selected topics.
- `js/assign.js` – Packs filtered lessons into scheduled visits while respecting time and age constraints.
- `js/schedule.js` – Renders the schedule table, summary details, and CSV export functionality.

## Development

Open `index.html` in a browser or serve the directory with a static file server (for example, `python -m http.server`) to run the tool locally.
